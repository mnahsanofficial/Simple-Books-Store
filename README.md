# Book Listing Application

A responsive book listing application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app fetches data from the [Gutendex API](https://gutendex.com/) to display a list of books, allowing users to search, filter by genre, add books to a wishlist, and paginate through the book list.
